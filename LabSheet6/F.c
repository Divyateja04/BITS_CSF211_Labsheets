// Given an array of integers
// Need to create a new list from the given array following a sequence of operations
// In each operation, you remove the first element of the given array and add it either to the beginning of the end of the list

// We need to find the lexographically smallest list - meaning sorted list or the numbers are the smallest
// Need to implement a double-ended queue

// I am thinking using dequeue and trying to sort them the least possible way will work
// As in if the digit is greater than the first one, it goes to the back
// else it goes to the front
